**Feedback:**

This resume has potential but needs significant restructuring and improvement to be truly effective.  Here's a breakdown:

**Strengths:**

* **Technical Skills:** The resume lists a decent range of technical skills relevant to data science and software development (Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, etc.).
* **Projects:**  Listing projects is good, but they need more detail.
* **Education:**  Listing both NIIT University and IIT Madras is positive, highlighting strong academic background.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Format and Structure:** The resume is poorly formatted and lacks a clear, logical structure. Information is haphazardly placed, making it difficult to read and understand.  There's no clear separation of sections, and the use of bullet points is inconsistent.
* **Experience:** The internship description is too brief and lacks quantifiable achievements.  Phrases like "Shadowed daily activities" are vague and don't demonstrate impact.
* **Project Descriptions:** The project descriptions are incredibly brief and lack context.  Instead of just listing project titles and technologies, describe the problem solved, your contribution, and the outcome (quantifiable results are best).  For example, instead of "Java Swing GUI implementation for a healthcare management system with MySQL," write something like "Developed a Java Swing GUI for a healthcare management system using MySQL, improving data access efficiency by X% and reducing user input errors by Y%."
* **Certifications:** The certifications are listed in a disorganized manner, and the links are unnecessarily long.  Simply list the names of certifications without the hyperlinks. The phone number and email are also awkwardly placed.
* **Skills Section:** The skills section needs better organization and categorization.  Group similar skills together.
* **Social Networks:** The LinkedIn profile URL is fine, but including a "Social Networks" section is unnecessary unless it includes other relevant platforms and contributes something meaningful to the application.


**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Revamp the Format:** Use a standard resume template or create a clean, easy-to-read layout with clear section headings (Summary/Objective, Skills, Experience, Education, Projects).
2. **Quantify Achievements:**  Use numbers and data to demonstrate the impact of your work in both your projects and experience sections.  Avoid vague statements and focus on results.
3. **Expand Project Descriptions:**  Provide more detail on each project, including the problem, your solution, technologies used, and quantifiable results.  Consider using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your project descriptions.
4. **Rewrite Internship Description:**  Focus on your accomplishments and quantifiable results during your internship.
5. **Organize Skills:** Group skills logically (e.g., Programming Languages, Databases, Frameworks, Tools).
6. **Refine Certifications:**  List certifications clearly and concisely, omitting the long hyperlinks.
7. **Add a Summary/Objective:**  Begin with a brief summary highlighting your key skills and career goals.  This will grab the recruiter's attention.
8. **Proofread Carefully:** Ensure there are no grammatical errors or typos.


By implementing these changes, Anish can significantly improve his resume's effectiveness and increase his chances of getting interviews.  The current version presents a capable candidate but doesn't effectively communicate their value proposition to potential employers.
